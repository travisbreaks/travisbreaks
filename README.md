# travisBREAKS

A systems builder with a performer's ear and a lyricist's eye. I design environments, route signal through chaos, and build tools that hold under pressure. 27-year DJ arc, four albums, psychology student, former Army NCO, and a decade of Fortune 500 operations. Now building with code the same way I've always built with sound: structure first, then energy.
