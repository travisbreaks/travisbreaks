# travisBREAKS

Music producer, creative technologist, experimental web developer.

Building at the intersection of audio, visual art, and code. Everything ships from a single monorepo.

## What I Build

**Audio-visual experiments** using Three.js, R3F, GLSL shaders, and Web Audio API. Scroll-driven physics, reactive 3D visualizers, algorithmic composition with SuperCollider.

**Production tools** like project scoring dashboards, API usage trackers, and voice-first fitness apps.

**Music** under [travisBREAKS](https://soundcloud.com/travisbreaks) across hip-hop, electronic, ambient, and experimental genres.
